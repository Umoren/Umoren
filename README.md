### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!-- **Umoren/Umoren** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->
I am a Frontend Engineer experienced in the art of building world-class products that meet and conform to industry standards, stand the test of time and deliver an excellent experience to the end-users âœ¨.

My focus area for the past few years has been with React, Vue, TypeScript, and technical content creation. 

When i'm not building products or writing articles, i'm:
* Working on my Data Engineering Leaning Path
* Algo & DS
* doing something fun
