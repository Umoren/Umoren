**Hi there ðŸ‘‹**

I'm a technical writer with a strong engineering background. I specialize in developer documentation, API guides, and technical tutorials. My programming experience helps me create docs that developers actually want to read. âœ¨

My focus areas include:
* Docs-as-code and documentation systems
* Developer experience and API documentation
* Technical writing methodologies and best practices
* Open source contributions and community engagement
* AI tooling for technical writers

When I'm not crafting documentation or contributing to open source, I'm:
* Building side projects
* Exploring new documentation frameworks
* Speaking at meetups (hopefully soon!)
* Doing something fun
